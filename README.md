EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step before diving into more advanced analysis or building models. It helps you understand the data's characteristics, identify potential challenges, and gather insights that guide your analysis direction.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the "Sample - Superstore" dataset involves a preliminary examination of the data to understand its structure, patterns, and potential insights. Here's a general description   

Data Loading: Import the dataset into your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Tableau, Excel, Python) and ensure that all columns are correctly imported.

Data Overview: Start by viewing a few rows of the dataset to get a sense of the data structure. Check the column names, data types, and the first few records.

Data Summary: Generate summary statistics for numerical columns, such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. This provides a quick overview of the data's central tendency and spread.

Missing Values: Identify if there are any missing values in the dataset and decide how to handle them. This step is crucial for accurate analysis.

Data Distribution: Create histograms or density plots to visualize the distribution of numerical variables. This helps in understanding data patterns and potential outliers.

Categorical Variables: Explore the distribution of categorical variables through bar charts or frequency tables. This helps in understanding the prevalence of different categories.

Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients between numerical variables to identify potential relationships. Create correlation heatmaps for visual representation.
